          Our app is not intended for children under 18 years of age. No one under 18 may create an
          account, provide personal information, or engage with our services. If we become aware
          that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without
          verification of parental consent, we will take immediate action to delete that
          information. If you suspect any violations of this policy, please contact us at
          support@cvnl.app

            <h3 id="prohibited-conduct" class="lead">2. Prohibited Conduct</h3>
          </a>

          We have a zero-tolerance policy for content, behavior, or interactions that facilitate,
          promote, or involve child sexual abuse and exploitation. This includes but is not limited
          to: Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM): Any form of content involving child exploitation,
          including images, videos, text, or links. Child Grooming: Any attempt to befriend,
          manipulate, or exploit minors for sexual purposes, whether online or offline.
          Sexualization of Minors: Content that depicts, encourages, or promotes the sexual abuse or
          sexualization of children. Sextortion: Threats or blackmail involving a child’s intimate
          images. Child Trafficking: Soliciting, advertising, or facilitating the commercial sexual
          exploitation of a minor. Inappropriate Interaction: Any behavior targeted at minors that
          involves groping, caressing, or other forms of predatory conduct. Any attempt to engage in
          these behaviors will result in immediate account termination and may be reported to
          relevant law enforcement authorities and child protection organizations.

          To protect users and prevent CSAE violations, we implement the following: Strict
          Moderation: We employ AI and human review to detect and remove any prohibited content
          related to child exploitation. User Reporting System: Users can report any suspicious or
          inappropriate content directly within the app. Reports will be reviewed promptly, and
          necessary action will be taken.

              4. Compliance with Child Safety Laws
            </h3>
          </a>

          We strictly adhere to all applicable child safety laws and regulations. This includes:
          Immediate Action on CSAM: Any verified CSAM content will be removed, and appropriate
          authorities will be notified. User Ban and Legal Action: Users who violate this policy
          will be permanently banned and may face legal consequences. Transparency and Compliance:
